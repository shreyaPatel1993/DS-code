# DS-code in JS
This Project has all Data Structures I worked on from Stratch to build it in JavaScript.

1. Binary Tree
2. Binary Search Tree
3. Singly Linked List
4. Doubly Linked List
5. Queue

note: Graphs and other DS will be added in future as I work on.

# About Project:
1. It has all the DS to be use in Modular form.
2. All DS are in seprate Components/files (you can find it in its repective js file/components).
3. All the module files are integrated and exported from Package.js file.
4. main.js is using all imports/ DS files from Package.js which is used to bundle up this Project and main.js is integrated in index.html as start/script js file.
5. This project must run on a server (to view or start the project because files are imported and exported as module): 
	 I am using "Live Preview" extension in VScode - which enables to run server in editor and can also be viewed in editor or in your browser.
6. If you don't want to run this project, If you are using it just for Interview practice then I would highly recommend Installing "Quokka" extension which enables you to debug/see output in code and also in editor's terminal, there is much more to Quokka - you can visit its website to see all the features.

Special Thanks to: Colt Steele (I say it JS GOD!!! haha!).
Most of everything in here I learned it from his online udemy course where he really explained very well, even for those who are not JS devs, this course is amazing.
