    <h1> DS & Algo </h1>
    <ul>
        <li> It has all the DS to be use in Modular form</li>  
        <li> All DS are in seprate Components/files (you can find it in its repective js file/components) </li>
        <li> All the module files are integrated and exported from Package.js file</li>
        <li> main.js is using all imports/ DS files from Package.js which is used to bundle up this Project</li>
        <li> This project must run on a server (to view or start the project because files are imported and exported as module): 
            <br> I am using <b>"Live Preview"</b> extension in VScode - which enables to run server in editor and can also be viewed in editor or in your browser</li>
        <li>If you don't want to run this project, If you are using it just for Interview practice then I would highly recommend Installing <b>"Quokka" extension </b>which enables to debug/see output in code and also in editor's terminal </li>
